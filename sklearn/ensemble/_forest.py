"""
Forest of trees-based ensemble methods.

Those methods include random forests and extremely randomized trees.

The module structure is the following:

- The ``BaseForest`` base class implements a common ``fit`` method for all
  the estimators in the module. The ``fit`` method of the base ``Forest``
  class calls the ``fit`` method of each sub-estimator on random samples
  (with replacement, a.k.a. bootstrap) of the training set.

  The init of the sub-estimator is further delegated to the
  ``BaseEnsemble`` constructor.

- The ``ForestClassifier`` and ``ForestRegressor`` base classes further
  implement the prediction logic by computing an average of the predicted
  outcomes of the sub-estimators.

- The ``RandomForestClassifier`` and ``RandomForestRegressor`` derived
  classes provide the user with concrete implementations of
  the forest ensemble method using classical, deterministic
  ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` and ``DecisionTreeRegressor`` as
  sub-estimator implementations.

- The ``ExtraTreesClassifier`` and ``ExtraTreesRegressor`` derived
  classes provide the user with concrete implementations of the
  forest ensemble method using the extremely randomized trees
  ``ExtraTreeClassifier`` and ``ExtraTreeRegressor`` as
  sub-estimator implementations.

Single and multi-output problems are both handled.

    """
    A random forest classifier.

    A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree
    classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to
    improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
    Trees in the forest use the best split strategy, i.e. equivalent to passing
    `splitter="best"` to the underlying :class:`~sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`.
    The sub-sample size is controlled with the `max_samples` parameter if
    `bootstrap=True` (default), otherwise the whole dataset is used to build
    each tree.

    For a comparison between tree-based ensemble models see the example
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_ensemble_plot_forest_hist_grad_boosting_comparison.py`.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <forest>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, default=100
        The number of trees in the forest.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
           The default value of ``n_estimators`` changed from 10 to 100
           in 0.22.

    criterion : {"gini", "entropy", "log_loss"}, default="gini"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are
        "gini" for the Gini impurity and "log_loss" and "entropy" both for the
        Shannon information gain, see :ref:`tree_mathematical_formulation`.
        Note: This parameter is tree-specific.

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : {"sqrt", "log2", None}, int or float, default="sqrt"
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_))` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1
            The default of `max_features` changed from `"auto"` to `"sqrt"`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    bootstrap : bool, default=True
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the
        whole dataset is used to build each tree.

    oob_score : bool or callable, default=False
        Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization score.
        By default, :func:`~sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score` is used.
        Provide a callable with signature `metric(y_true, y_pred)` to use a
        custom metric. Only available if `bootstrap=True`.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`fit`, :meth:`predict`,
        :meth:`decision_path` and :meth:`apply` are all parallelized over the
        trees. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
        context. ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary
        <n_jobs>` for more details.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls both the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used
        when building trees (if ``bootstrap=True``) and the sampling of the
        features to consider when looking for the best split at each node
        (if ``max_features < n_features``).
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest. See :term:`Glossary <warm_start>` and
        :ref:`tree_ensemble_warm_start` for details.

    class_weight : {"balanced", "balanced_subsample"}, dict or list of dicts, \
            default=None
        Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
        If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For
        multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same
        order as the columns of y.

        Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be
        defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example,
        for four-class multilabel classification weights should be
        [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of
        [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].

        The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``

        The "balanced_subsample" mode is the same as "balanced" except that
        weights are computed based on the bootstrap sample for every tree
        grown.

        For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.

        Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed
        through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
        :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details. See
        :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_tree_plot_cost_complexity_pruning.py`
        for an example of such pruning.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    max_samples : int or float, default=None
        If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X
        to train each base estimator.

        - If None (default), then draw `X.shape[0]` samples.
        - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
        - If float, then draw `max(round(n_samples * max_samples), 1)` samples. Thus,
          `max_samples` should be in the interval `(0.0, 1.0]`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    max_bins : int, default=255
        The maximum number of bins to use for non-missing values.

        **This is an experimental feature**.

    store_leaf_values : bool, default=False
        Whether to store the leaf values in the ``get_leaf_node_samples`` function.

        **This is an experimental feature**.

    monotonic_cst : array-like of int of shape (n_features), default=None
        Indicates the monotonicity constraint to enforce on each feature.
          - 1: monotonic increase
          - 0: no constraint
          - -1: monotonic decrease

        If monotonic_cst is None, no constraints are applied.

        Monotonicity constraints are not supported for:
          - multiclass classifications (i.e. when `n_classes > 2`),
          - multioutput classifications (i.e. when `n_outputs_ > 1`),
          - classifications trained on data with missing values.

        The constraints hold over the probability of the positive class.

        total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature.  It is also
        known as the Gini importance.

        Warning: impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for

        set. If n_estimators is small it might be possible that a data point
        was never left out during the bootstrap. In this case,

    Notes
    -----
    The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
    (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
    unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
    controlled by setting those parameter values.

    The features are always randomly permuted at each split. Therefore,
    the best found split may vary, even with the same training data,
    ``max_features=n_features`` and ``bootstrap=False``, if the improvement
    of the criterion is identical for several splits enumerated during the
    search of the best split. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during
    fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed.

class RandomForestRegressor(ForestRegressor):
    """
    A random forest regressor.

    A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree
    regressors on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to
    improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
    Trees in the forest use the best split strategy, i.e. equivalent to passing
    `splitter="best"` to the underlying :class:`~sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor`.
    The sub-sample size is controlled with the `max_samples` parameter if
    `bootstrap=True` (default), otherwise the whole dataset is used to build
    each tree.

    For a comparison between tree-based ensemble models see the example
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_ensemble_plot_forest_hist_grad_boosting_comparison.py`.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <forest>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, default=100
        The number of trees in the forest.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
           The default value of ``n_estimators`` changed from 10 to 100
           in 0.22.

    criterion : {"squared_error", "absolute_error", "friedman_mse", "poisson"}, \
            default="squared_error"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "squared_error" for the mean squared error, which is equal to
        variance reduction as feature selection criterion and minimizes the L2
        loss using the mean of each terminal node, "friedman_mse", which uses
        mean squared error with Friedman's improvement score for potential
        splits, "absolute_error" for the mean absolute error, which minimizes
        the L1 loss using the median of each terminal node, and "poisson" which
        uses reduction in Poisson deviance to find splits.
        Training using "absolute_error" is significantly slower
        than when using "squared_error".

        .. versionadded:: 0.18
           Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0
           Poisson criterion.

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : {"sqrt", "log2", None}, int or float, default=1.0
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_))` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None or 1.0, then `max_features=n_features`.

        .. note::
            The default of 1.0 is equivalent to bagged trees and more
            randomness can be achieved by setting smaller values, e.g. 0.3.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1
            The default of `max_features` changed from `"auto"` to 1.0.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    bootstrap : bool, default=True
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the
        whole dataset is used to build each tree.

    oob_score : bool or callable, default=False
        Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization score.
        By default, :func:`~sklearn.metrics.r2_score` is used.
        Provide a callable with signature `metric(y_true, y_pred)` to use a
        custom metric. Only available if `bootstrap=True`.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`fit`, :meth:`predict`,
        :meth:`decision_path` and :meth:`apply` are all parallelized over the
        trees. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
        context. ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary
        <n_jobs>` for more details.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls both the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used
        when building trees (if ``bootstrap=True``) and the sampling of the
        features to consider when looking for the best split at each node
        (if ``max_features < n_features``).
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest. See :term:`Glossary <warm_start>` and
        :ref:`tree_ensemble_warm_start` for details.

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
        :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details. See
        :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_tree_plot_cost_complexity_pruning.py`
        for an example of such pruning.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    max_samples : int or float, default=None
        If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X
        to train each base estimator.

        - If None (default), then draw `X.shape[0]` samples.
        - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
        - If float, then draw `max(round(n_samples * max_samples), 1)` samples. Thus,
          `max_samples` should be in the interval `(0.0, 1.0]`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    max_bins : int, default=255
        The maximum number of bins to use for non-missing values. Used for
        speeding up training time.

        **This is an experimental feature**.

    store_leaf_values : bool, default=False
        Whether to store the leaf values in the ``get_leaf_node_samples`` function.

        **This is an experimental feature**.

    monotonic_cst : array-like of int of shape (n_features), default=None
        Indicates the monotonicity constraint to enforce on each feature.
          - 1: monotonically increasing
          - 0: no constraint
          - -1: monotonically decreasing

        If monotonic_cst is None, no constraints are applied.

        Monotonicity constraints are not supported for:
          - multioutput regressions (i.e. when `n_outputs_ > 1`),
          - regressions trained on data with missing values.

    The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
    (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
    unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
    controlled by setting those parameter values.

    The features are always randomly permuted at each split. Therefore,
    the best found split may vary, even with the same training data,
    ``max_features=n_features`` and ``bootstrap=False``, if the improvement
    of the criterion is identical for several splits enumerated during the
    search of the best split. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during
    fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed.

    The default value ``max_features=1.0`` uses ``n_features``
    rather than ``n_features / 3``. The latter was originally suggested in
    [1], whereas the former was more recently justified empirically in [2].

class ExtraTreesClassifier(ForestClassifier):
    """
    An extra-trees classifier.

    This class implements a meta estimator that fits a number of
    randomized decision trees (a.k.a. extra-trees) on various sub-samples
    of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy
    and control over-fitting.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <forest>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, default=100
        The number of trees in the forest.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
           The default value of ``n_estimators`` changed from 10 to 100
           in 0.22.

    criterion : {"gini", "entropy", "log_loss"}, default="gini"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are
        "gini" for the Gini impurity and "log_loss" and "entropy" both for the
        Shannon information gain, see :ref:`tree_mathematical_formulation`.
        Note: This parameter is tree-specific.

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : {"sqrt", "log2", None}, int or float, default="sqrt"
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_))` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1
            The default of `max_features` changed from `"auto"` to `"sqrt"`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    bootstrap : bool, default=False
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the
        whole dataset is used to build each tree.

    oob_score : bool or callable, default=False
        Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization score.
        By default, :func:`~sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score` is used.
        Provide a callable with signature `metric(y_true, y_pred)` to use a
        custom metric. Only available if `bootstrap=True`.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`fit`, :meth:`predict`,
        :meth:`decision_path` and :meth:`apply` are all parallelized over the
        trees. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
        context. ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary
        <n_jobs>` for more details.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls 3 sources of randomness:

        - the bootstrapping of the samples used when building trees
          (if ``bootstrap=True``)
        - the sampling of the features to consider when looking for the best
          split at each node (if ``max_features < n_features``)
        - the draw of the splits for each of the `max_features`

        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest. See :term:`Glossary <warm_start>` and
        :ref:`tree_ensemble_warm_start` for details.

    class_weight : {"balanced", "balanced_subsample"}, dict or list of dicts, \
            default=None
        Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
        If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For
        multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same
        order as the columns of y.

        Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be
        defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example,
        for four-class multilabel classification weights should be
        [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of
        [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].

        The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``

        The "balanced_subsample" mode is the same as "balanced" except that
        weights are computed based on the bootstrap sample for every tree
        grown.

        For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.

        Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed
        through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
        :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details. See
        :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_tree_plot_cost_complexity_pruning.py`
        for an example of such pruning.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    max_samples : int or float, default=None
        If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X
        to train each base estimator.

        - If None (default), then draw `X.shape[0]` samples.
        - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
        - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples. Thus,
          `max_samples` should be in the interval `(0.0, 1.0]`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    max_bins : int, default=255
        The maximum number of bins to use for non-missing values.

        **This is an experimental feature**.

    store_leaf_values : bool, default=False
        Whether to store the leaf values in the ``get_leaf_node_samples`` function.

        **This is an experimental feature**.

    monotonic_cst : array-like of int of shape (n_features), default=None
        Indicates the monotonicity constraint to enforce on each feature.
          - 1: monotonically increasing
          - 0: no constraint
          - -1: monotonically decreasing

        If monotonic_cst is None, no constraints are applied.

        Monotonicity constraints are not supported for:
          - multiclass classifications (i.e. when `n_classes > 2`),
          - multioutput classifications (i.e. when `n_outputs_ > 1`),
          - classifications trained on data with missing values.

        The constraints hold over the probability of the positive class.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimator_ : :class:`~sklearn.tree.ExtraTreeClassifier`
        The child estimator template used to create the collection of fitted
        sub-estimators.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2
           `base_estimator_` was renamed to `estimator_`.

    estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeClassifier
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    classes_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,) or a list of such arrays
        The classes labels (single output problem), or a list of arrays of
        class labels (multi-output problem).

    n_classes_ : int or list
        The number of classes (single output problem), or a list containing the
        number of classes for each output (multi-output problem).

    feature_importances_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        The impurity-based feature importances.
        The higher, the more important the feature.
        The importance of a feature is computed as the (normalized)
        total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature.  It is also
        known as the Gini importance.

        Warning: impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for
        high cardinality features (many unique values). See
        :func:`sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance` as an alternative.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    n_outputs_ : int
        The number of outputs when ``fit`` is performed.

    oob_score_ : float
        Score of the training dataset obtained using an out-of-bag estimate.
        This attribute exists only when ``oob_score`` is True.

    oob_decision_function_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_classes) or \
            (n_samples, n_classes, n_outputs)
        Decision function computed with out-of-bag estimate on the training
        set. If n_estimators is small it might be possible that a data point
        was never left out during the bootstrap. In this case,
        `oob_decision_function_` might contain NaN. This attribute exists
        only when ``oob_score`` is True.

    estimators_samples_ : list of arrays
        The subset of drawn samples (i.e., the in-bag samples) for each base
        estimator. Each subset is defined by an array of the indices selected.

        .. versionadded:: 1.4

    and control over-fitting.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <forest>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, default=100
        The number of trees in the forest.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
           The default value of ``n_estimators`` changed from 10 to 100
           in 0.22.

    criterion : {"squared_error", "absolute_error", "friedman_mse", "poisson"}, \
            default="squared_error"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "squared_error" for the mean squared error, which is equal to
        variance reduction as feature selection criterion and minimizes the L2
        loss using the mean of each terminal node, "friedman_mse", which uses
        mean squared error with Friedman's improvement score for potential
        splits, "absolute_error" for the mean absolute error, which minimizes
        the L1 loss using the median of each terminal node, and "poisson" which
        uses reduction in Poisson deviance to find splits.
        Training using "absolute_error" is significantly slower
        than when using "squared_error".

        .. versionadded:: 0.18
           Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion.

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : {"sqrt", "log2", None}, int or float, default=1.0
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_))` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None or 1.0, then `max_features=n_features`.

        .. note::
            The default of 1.0 is equivalent to bagged trees and more
            randomness can be achieved by setting smaller values, e.g. 0.3.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1
            The default of `max_features` changed from `"auto"` to 1.0.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    bootstrap : bool, default=False
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the
        whole dataset is used to build each tree.

    oob_score : bool or callable, default=False
        Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization score.
        By default, :func:`~sklearn.metrics.r2_score` is used.
        Provide a callable with signature `metric(y_true, y_pred)` to use a
        custom metric. Only available if `bootstrap=True`.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`fit`, :meth:`predict`,
        :meth:`decision_path` and :meth:`apply` are all parallelized over the
        trees. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
        context. ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary
        <n_jobs>` for more details.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls 3 sources of randomness:

        - the bootstrapping of the samples used when building trees
          (if ``bootstrap=True``)
        - the sampling of the features to consider when looking for the best
          split at each node (if ``max_features < n_features``)
        - the draw of the splits for each of the `max_features`

        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest. See :term:`Glossary <warm_start>` and
        :ref:`tree_ensemble_warm_start` for details.

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
        :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details. See
        :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_tree_plot_cost_complexity_pruning.py`
        for an example of such pruning.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    max_samples : int or float, default=None
        If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X
        to train each base estimator.

        - If None (default), then draw `X.shape[0]` samples.
        - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
        - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples. Thus,
          `max_samples` should be in the interval `(0.0, 1.0]`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    max_bins : int, default=255
        The maximum number of bins to use for non-missing values.

        **This is an experimental feature**.

    store_leaf_values : bool, default=False
        Whether to store the leaf values in the ``get_leaf_node_samples`` function.

        **This is an experimental feature**.

    monotonic_cst : array-like of int of shape (n_features), default=None
        Indicates the monotonicity constraint to enforce on each feature.
          - 1: monotonically increasing
          - 0: no constraint
          - -1: monotonically decreasing

        If monotonic_cst is None, no constraints are applied.

        Monotonicity constraints are not supported for:
          - multioutput regressions (i.e. when `n_outputs_ > 1`),
          - regressions trained on data with missing values.

        known as the Gini importance.

        Warning: impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for
        high cardinality features (many unique values). See
        :func:`sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance` as an alternative.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)

        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    n_outputs_ : int
        The number of outputs.

    oob_score_ : float
        Score of the training dataset obtained using an out-of-bag estimate.

    Notes
    -----
    The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
    (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
    unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
    controlled by setting those parameter values.

class RandomTreesEmbedding(TransformerMixin, BaseForest):
    """
    An ensemble of totally random trees.

    An unsupervised transformation of a dataset to a high-dimensional
    sparse representation. A datapoint is coded according to which leaf of
    each tree it is sorted into. Using a one-hot encoding of the leaves,
    this leads to a binary coding with as many ones as there are trees in
    the forest.

    The dimensionality of the resulting representation is
    ``n_out <= n_estimators * max_leaf_nodes``. If ``max_leaf_nodes == None``,
    the number of leaf nodes is at most ``n_estimators * 2 ** max_depth``.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <random_trees_embedding>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, default=100
        Number of trees in the forest.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
           The default value of ``n_estimators`` changed from 10 to 100
           in 0.22.

    max_depth : int, default=5
        The maximum depth of each tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` is the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` is the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all

        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

        <n_jobs>` for more details.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the generation of the random `y` used to fit the trees
        and the draw of the splits for each feature at the trees' nodes.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
