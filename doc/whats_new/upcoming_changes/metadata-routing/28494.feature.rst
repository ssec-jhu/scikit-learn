- :class:`semi_supervised.SelfTrainingClassifier`
  now supports metadata routing. The fit method now accepts ``**fit_params``
  which are passed to the underlying estimators via their `fit` methods.
  In addition, the `predict`, `predict_proba`, `predict_log_proba`, `score`
  and `decision_function` methods also accept ``**params`` which are
  passed to the underlying estimators via their respective methods.
