- :class:`linear_model.RidgeCV` now properly uses predictions on the same scale as
  the target seen during `fit`. These predictions are stored in `cv_results_` when
  `scoring != None`. Previously, the predictions were rescaled by the square root of the
  sample weights and offset by the mean of the target, leading to an incorrect estimate
  of the score.
